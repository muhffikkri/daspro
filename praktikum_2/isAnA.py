"""
Maxwell, with his peculiar yet charming uniqueness, has a very specific fondness for the letter 'a'. No other character can capture his attention like 'a'â€”not 'y', and certainly not strange symbols like '@'. Therefore, he challenges you to create a function that can distinguish between 'a' and all other characters. Without hesitation, you create the function is_an_a(c), which ensures whether the given character is the star, 'a'. If the character is 'a', Maxwell will cheer with joy; however, if it is not, Maxwell will know that it is not his favorite!
